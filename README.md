# Greenhouse Gases Visualization

## Overview

This project focuses on **visualizing CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions** using interactive tools to aid in data-driven decision-making. The work showcases how AR/VR-inspired interactivity, combined with data visualization techniques, can improve understanding of global climate change trends and their impact.

The project includes:
- Trend analysis of CO2 emissions across countries and sectors.
- Interactive exploration of data using an **R Shiny app**.

## Features

- **Interactive R Shiny App**: Visualize emissions data by country, continent, or sector.
- **Data Insights**: Understand CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and GHG trends over time.
- **Visualizations**: Clean and informative graphs for researchers, policymakers, and the general public.

## Dataset

We used the **CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset** from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions). The dataset provides a comprehensive view of emissions by:
- Countries and regions
- Sectors (e.g., energy, transportation)
- Per-capita metrics
